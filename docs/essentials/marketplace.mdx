<Note>
AI-commerce helps small businesses compete with large retailers by making their products easily accessible
to Nostr-powered AI agents. These agents act as one-stop shops, eliminating the need for buyers
to search across multiple websites.
</Note>

## Merchants
Merchants expose their product catalog through Nostr, making it avaiable to both humans and AI agents:
- Humans can browse the catalog and make purchases using Nostr-compatible web applications like https://plebeian.market/.
- Agents can process the catalog and interact with their users to find the right product from any Nostr-powered merchant.

Buyers find merchants using the same tools described in [Dynamic Agent Discovery](/essentials/findagents):
- `namespace`: `com.synvya.merchant`
- `label`: `restaurant`
- `hashtag`: [`italian`, `reservations`, `takeout`, `delivery`]

<Info>
The hashtags are just examples, merchants can use any hashtags they want.

## Stalls
NIP-15 defines a `Stall` as a collection of products or services offered by a merchant
and grouped by a common currency and shipping costs.

Merchants can interpret different stalls as different physical locations or different product categories.
For example, a restaurant with multiple locations might have one stall for each location. A small shop
might have one stall for the physical location and another stall for the online store.

Merchants may also opt to use a single stall for all of their products and services.

<Note>
Synvya extends this definition to include a geographic location for the stall encoded as
a [geohash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash) to enable stall discovery based on location.
</Note>

The example below shows how to define a stall with two shipping rates.

```python
stall_shipping_methods = [
    StallShippingMethod(
        ssm_id="merchant-001-shipping-1",
        ssm_cost=10,
        ssm_name="North America",
        ssm_regions=["Canada", "Mexico", "USA"],
    ),
    StallShippingMethod(
        ssm_id="merchant-001-shipping-2",
        ssm_cost=20,
        ssm_name="Rest of the World",
        ssm_regions=["All other countries"],
    )
]

stalls = [
    Stall(
        id="merchant-001-stall-1",
        name="The Retail Store",
        description="Your neighborhood hardware store",
        currency="USD",
        shipping=stall_shipping_methods,
        geohash="c23q7u33",
    ),
    Stall(
        id="merchant-002-stall-2",
        name="The Online Store",
        description="Your neighborhood hardware store, now online.",
        currency="USD",
        shipping=stall_shipping_methods,
        geohash="c23q7u33",
    ),
]
```

## Products
NIP-15 defines a `Product` as a single item for sale. Products are assigned to a single `Stall` and
the merchant may add additional shipping costs to the product on top of the costs defined in the `Stall`
(e.g. a product that is heavier than the average product in the stall).

<Note>
Synvya extends the NIP-15 definition to include a direct reference to the seller's Nostr public key
to enable easier indexing of products based on the seller's identity.
</Note>

The example below shows how to define multiple products and how to add extra shipping costs to
some of them.

```python

product_shipping_costs = [
    ProductShippingCost(psc_id="merchant-001-shipping-1", psc_cost=5),
    ProductShippingCost(psc_id="merchant-001-shipping-2", psc_cost=10),
]

products = [
    Product(
        id="merchant-001-product-1",
        stall_id="merchant-001-stall-1",
        name="Wrench",
        description="The perfect tool for a $5 wrench attack.",
        images=["https://i.nostr.build/BddyYILz0rjv1wEY.png"],
        currency="USD",
        price=5,
        quantity=100,
        shipping=None,
        specs=[["length", "10cm"], ["material", "steel"]],
        categories=["hardware", "tools"],
        seller=keys.get_public_key(),
    ),
    Product(
        id="merchant-001-product-2",
        stall_id="merchant-001-stall-1",
        name="Shovel",
        description="Dig yourself into a hole like never before",
        images=["https://i.nostr.build/psL0ZtN4FZcmeiIh.png"],
        currency="USD",
        price=25,
        quantity=10,
        shipping=product_shipping_costs,
        specs=[["length", "100 cm"], ["material", "steel"]],
        categories=["hardware", "tools"],
        seller=keys.get_public_key(),
    ),
    Product(
        id="merchant-001-product-3",
        stall_id="merchant-001-stall-2",
        name="Shovel 101",
        description="How to dig your own grave",
        images=["https://i.nostr.build/psL0ZtN4FZcmeiIh.png"],
        currency="USD",
        price=9.99,
        quantity=1000,
        shipping=None,
        specs=[["type", "online"], ["media", "video"]],
        categories=["education", "hardware tools"],
        seller=keys.get_public_key(),
    ),
]
```
