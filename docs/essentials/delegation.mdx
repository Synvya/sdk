The Synvya SDK provides comprehensive support for NIP-26 delegation, allowing merchants to delegate publishing rights to servers or other entities while maintaining control over their identity and content.

## Overview
NIP-26 delegation enables a merchant (delegator) to grant specific publishing permissions to another party (delegatee) without sharing their private key. This is particularly useful for:
Allowing servers to publish events on behalf of merchants
Enabling automated systems to manage marketplace content
Implementing secure multi-user merchant management

## Key Components
### Delegation Class
The `Delegation` class wraps and validates NIP-26 delegation events (kind 30078):

```python
from synvya_sdk import Delegation

# Parse a delegation event from JSON
delegation = Delegation.parse(delegation_event_json)

# Access delegation properties
print(f"Delegator: {delegation.author}")
print(f"Expires at: {delegation.expires_at}")
print(f"Allowed kinds: {delegation.allowed_kinds}")
```
### Properties
- `author`: Merchant's public key (bech32 or hex)
- `conditions`: Raw query string defining delegation constraints
- `sig`: Merchant's signature
- `tag`: Complete delegation tag for re-attachment
- `created_at`: Delegation creation timestamp (Unix)
- `expires_at`: Delegation expiry timestamp (Unix)
- `allowed_kinds`: Set of event kinds that can be published

### NostrClient with Delegation
The `NostrClient` can be initialized with a delegation event to automatically use it for publishing:
```python
from synvya_sdk import NostrClient

# Create client with delegation
nostr_client = await NostrClient.create(
    relays=["wss://relay.example.com"],
    private_key="delegatee_private_key",
    delegation_event=delegation_event_json
)
```

## Creating a Delegation Event
A merchant creates a delegation event (kind 30078) that includes:
- Delegation tag: ["delegation", delegatee_pubkey, conditions, delegation_token]
- Conditions: Query string specifying constraints like allowed kinds and expiry
- Signature: Merchant's signature over the delegation

Example delegation event structure:

```json
{
  "kind": 30078,
  "pubkey": "merchant_pubkey",
  "created_at": 1234567890,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    [
      "delegation",
      "delegatee_pubkey",
      "kind=30017,30018&created_at=1234567890&expires_at=1234567999",
      "delegation_token"
    ]
  ],
  "sig": "merchant_signature"
}
```

## Methods
### Delegation.parse(raw)
Converts raw JSON (string or dict) of a kind 30078 event into a validated Delegation instance.
- Parameters:
  - raw: JSON string or dictionary containing the delegation event
- Returns:
  - Delegation: Validated delegation instance
- Raises:
  - ValueError: If event is not kind 30078, has invalid signature, or missing delegation tag

```python
# From JSON string
delegation = Delegation.parse(json_string)

# From dictionary
delegation = Delegation.parse(event_dict)
```
### delegation.validate_event(event)
Validates that a given event can be published under this delegation.
- Parameters:
  - event: Nostr event to validate
- Raises:
  - ValueError: If event kind not allowed or delegation expired

```python
from nostr_sdk import Event

# Validate before publishing
try:
    delegation.validate_event(event)
    print("Event is valid for this delegation")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Validation failed: {e}")
```
### delegation.delegation_tag
Property that returns the ready-made delegation tag for attaching to events before publishing.
```python
# Get tag for event publishing
tag = delegation.delegation_tag
# Returns: ["delegation", delegatee_pubkey, conditions, token]
```

## Usage Examples
### Server-Side Merchant Management
```python
import json
from synvya_sdk import NostrClient, Delegation, Stall, Product

async def setup_delegated_merchant():
    # Parse delegation from merchant
    delegation_event = {
        "kind": 30078,
        "pubkey": "merchant_pubkey",
        # ... complete delegation event
    }

    delegation = Delegation.parse(delegation_event)

    # Create client with delegation
    client = await NostrClient.create(
        relays=["wss://relay.example.com"],
        private_key="server_private_key",
        delegation_event=delegation_event
    )

    # Server can now publish on behalf of merchant
    stall = Stall(
        id="merchant-stall-1",
        name="Merchant's Store",
        description="Managed by server",
        currency="USD",
        shipping=[]
    )

    await client.async_set_stall(stall)
```

### Delegation Validation
```python
async def validate_delegation_permissions():
    delegation = Delegation.parse(delegation_json)

    # Check if delegation allows marketplace events
    allowed_kinds = {30017, 30018}  # Stall and Product kinds

    if not allowed_kinds.issubset(delegation.allowed_kinds):
        raise ValueError("Delegation doesn't allow marketplace events")

    # Check expiry
    import time
    if time.time() > delegation.expires_at:
        raise ValueError("Delegation has expired")

    print("Delegation is valid for marketplace operations")
```
## Security Considerations
- Signature Verification: All delegation events are cryptographically verified
- Time Bounds: Delegations include expiry timestamps for time-limited access
- Kind Restrictions: Only specified event kinds can be published
- Condition Parsing: Delegation conditions are parsed and validated
## Error Handling
The delegation system provides specific error messages for common issues:
```python
try:
    delegation = Delegation.parse(event_json)
    delegation.validate_event(some_event)
except ValueError as e:
    if "not a delegation" in str(e):
        print("Invalid delegation event format")
    elif "Invalid delegation signature" in str(e):
        print("Signature verification failed")
    elif "expired" in str(e):
        print("Delegation has expired")
    elif "not allowed" in str(e):
        print("Event kind not permitted by delegation")
```
## Best Practices
- Validate Early: Always validate delegation events immediately after parsing
- Check Expiry: Implement regular checks for delegation expiry
- Minimal Permissions: Request only the minimum required event kinds
- Secure Storage: Store delegation events securely on the server side
- Audit Trail: Log all actions performed under delegation for accountability
This delegation system enables secure, controlled publishing while maintaining the decentralized nature of Nostr and giving merchants fine-grained control over their digital presence.
