The Synvya SDK is a collection of tools that make it easy for developers to build agentic applications that
use Nostr as the underlying communication and identity layer.

The main class is NostrClient.

Two reference implementations are provided, both using the Agno agent framework:
- [Agentic Buyer](https://github.com/Synvya/sdk/tree/main/examples/basic_buyer)
- [Agentic Merchant](https://github.com/Synvya/sdk/tree/main/examples/basic_merchant)
